# Amps & Speakers

You will need an Amplifier per [sounder](/docs/configuration/sounders) that will take the audio signal from our sounder, aplify it and then send it out to the speakers.

This is incredibly situational. Ideally you will use a 100V line Amp wired to 100V speakers in every room, making sure that the wattage of the speakers doesn't exceed the maximum capacity of the amplifier.

With 100V systems speakers are connected to eachother, so you only need one cable from your amp to the first speaker, then from that to the next, and so on.
