# Why Open School Bell?
{: .fs-9 }

Open School Bell was originally developed for [Longridge High School](https://www.lhs.lancs.sch.uk) to replace an out-of-date radio triggered master-clock based system.

The main aim of OSB was to replace the system with a more reliable wired system, without breaking the bank. Commercial alternatives did offer what we wanted but also came with some concerns.

The spec for OSB to be a viable project was:

 - Local only, all parts of the system should run inside our school.
 - Network based and centerally managed, no jumping onto each pi or having to physically access hardware.
 - Lockdown capable.
 - Text-To-Speech for tannoys.
 - Tie-in to existing bells.

 Over the Easter Holiday's in 2025 we installed _Phase 1_ of our OSB project. This was 1 sounder, amp and 10 speakers into a newly constructed building, and a Pi with a [Pi Touch Display 2](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display-2) plus relay to act as our lockdown trigger and link into the exisitng bells.
