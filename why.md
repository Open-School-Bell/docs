# Why Open School Bell?
{: .fs-9 }

Open School Bell was originally developed for [Longridge High School](https://www.lhs.lancs.sch.uk) to replace an out-of-date radio boardcasting master-clock based system.

The main aim of OSB was to replace the system with a more reliable wired system, without breaking the bank. Commercial alternatives did offer what we wanted but also came with some concerns.

The spec for OSB was:

 - Local only, all parts of the system should run inside our school.
 - Network based and centerally managed, no jumping onto each pi or having to physically access hardware.
 - Lockdown capable.
