# Broadcast

Broadcast allows you instantly trigger a sound within a zone.

Start the _broadcast wizard_ from the _Broadcast_ link on the sidebar.

## Choosing what to broadcast

The first step is to select the type of the sound to be broadcast. This can either be an _Existing Sound_ or a _New Text to Speech_.

### Exisiting Sound

Simply select a sound from the dropdown and click Next.

### New Text to Speech

As with creating a tts sound, provide the text to be generated and _(optionally)_ a ringer wire string for the sound. 

Once generated click next to get to the next step.

## Where to broadcast


Select the Zone to broadcast to.
