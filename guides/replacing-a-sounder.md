# Replacing a Sounder

Pi's and thier SD Cards don't last forever and you may need to replace one in the lifetime of your OSB installation. The process is pretty simple in OSB.

1. [Install the sounder agent](/docs/installation/sounder/) on your new Pi.
1. In the controller hit the _Reset Key_ button on the sounder.
1. Run the new enroll command on the new sounder.

Thats it! Your new sounder will take on the configuration of the old one.
