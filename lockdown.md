# Lockdown

Lockdown is an extremely important part of a modern bell system. OSB is designed with lockdown at its heart.

When a lockdown is triggered the system enters lockdown mode and plays the _entry sound_ the configured number of times. Whilst in lockdown mode all scheduled bells are disabled and the _entry sound_ is repeated the configured number of minutes apart. When the lockdown ends and the system leaves lockdown mode the _exist sound_ is played.

## Testing

As with any emergency system in school your lockdown system needs to be tested regularly.

OSB has the benefit that all your speakers and sounders are tested every time your lesson change bell rings. It is suggested that you run a broadcast from the controller periodically to ensure that the controller is able to communicate with the sounders.
